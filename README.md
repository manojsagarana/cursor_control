cursor control using eye and hand movements

Cursor Control Using Hand and Eye Gestures is an intuitive, dual-mode interface designed to help users interact with their computer without touching a mouse or keyboard.

You can switch between Hand Control Mode and Eye Control Mode from the web UI.

Use gestures or blinks to:
- Move the cursor
- Click left/right
- Scroll up/down
- Switch applications (Alt+Tab)

This system was built with accessibility, hygiene, and immersive interaction in mind â€” ideal for physically impaired users, medical professionals, and futuristic UIs.

Track Chosen: AI/ML + Full Stack
We are combining powerful AI/ML-based gesture recognition with a rich full-stack web application**. This enables users to control and visualize gesture interactions in real time via the browser.


Problem Statement
What Problem Are We Solving?

- Accessibility: Physically challenged users cannot rely on traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard.
- Touchless Interfaces: In hospitals, labs, or clean rooms, hygienic (touch-free) interaction is critical.
- Immersive Computing: Gamers and AR/VR systems require new ways to control UIs without hardware.

Existing Solutions Are:
- Expensive (e.g., Tobii Eye Tracker)
- Hardware-restricted
- Platform-specific

Our Solution
A completely software-driven system that:
- Requires only a webcam
- Supports both eye and hand gesture control
- Is accessible via a beautiful 3D-themed web interface
- Provides instant switching between control modes
